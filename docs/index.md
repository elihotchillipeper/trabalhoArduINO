# INTRODUCTION
This Arduino program facilitates binary addition of 4-bit numbers using a full adder logic. It reads input from designated pins for two sets of 4-bit binary numbers (nib1 and nib2), computes the sum and carry using the fullAdder function, and outputs the results to specified pins. This software serves as an educational tool, demonstrating fundamental concepts in digital electronics and embedded programming through practical application.
